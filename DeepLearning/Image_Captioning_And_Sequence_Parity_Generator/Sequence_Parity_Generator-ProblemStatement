Let us define a sequence parity function as a function that takes in a sequence of binary inputs and returns a sequence indicating the number of 0’s in the input so far; specifically, if at time t the 0’s in the input so far is odd it returns 1, and 0 if it is even. For example, given input sequence [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], the parity sequence is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. 

 

Implement the minimal vanilla recurrent neural network to learn the parity function. Explain your rationale using a state transition diagram and parameters of the network.

 

Evaluation Process -

Task Response and Task Completion- All the models should be logically sound and have decent accuracy (models with random guessing, frozen and incorrect accuracy, exploding gradients, etc. will lead to deduction of marks. Please do a sanity check of your model and results before submission).
There are a lot of subparts, so answer each completely and correctly, as no partial marks will be awarded for partially correct subparts.
Implementation- The model layers, parameters, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, etc. should be properly implemented.
Notebooks without output will not be considered for evaluation.
Request to upload an HTML version of the jupyter notebook as well with all the outputs and comments.
Additional Tips -

Code organization- Please organize your code with correct line spacing and indentation, and add comments to make your code more readable.
Try to give explanations or cite references wherever required.
Use other combinations of hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
